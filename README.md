# Bank Customer Segmentation

-Firstly, I sourced the data using pd.read_csv().

-Then, I analyzed the data using shape, info and describe.

-Then, I dropped the null values.

-Then, I assigned balance and purchase column to X.

-Then, I calculated list of Within Cluster Sum of Square(WCSS) for 19 clusters.

-Then, I plotted elbow graph.

-Then, I chose the number of clusters, k=6.

-Then, I predicted cluster for each point in X.

-Then, I plotted scatterplot for each point in X in accordance to their cluster.

-Then, I plotted centroids of each cluster.


# We can infer that, customers from cluster 3 have high balance but less purchase. So bank can come up with strategies to encourage those customers to purchase more.
